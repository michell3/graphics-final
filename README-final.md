# Computer Graphics Final Project

For my project I tried implementing inserting an edgle loop for my mesh editor. Unfortunately the most that I could get working was inserting a vertex at an edge's midpoint. Even though I could not finish my final project, I enjoyed the class and gaining an appreciation for 3D software.

Happy Holidays
