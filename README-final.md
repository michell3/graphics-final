# Computer Graphics Final Project

For my project I tried implementing inserting an edgle loop for my mesh editor. Unfortunately the most that I could get working was inserting a vertex at an edge's midpoint.

(You can press 'g' to insert a vertex on a selected edge and 'G' to go into an infinite loop on a quad surface. Would not recommend.)

Even though I could not finish my final project, I enjoyed the class and gaining an appreciation for 3D software.

Happy Holidays
